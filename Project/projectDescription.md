# Barabási–Albert (BA) model

Create a scale-free network using the BA model(preferential attachment).

Preferential attachment means that the more connected a node is(higher degree or number of links), the more likely it is to receive new links.



We ask ourself: 

- What is the relationship between number of nodes present and how many  well-connected nodes exists.
- how the probability that a node will attach itself to a well-connected node increase based on the number of connection the node has
- If the preferential attachment is non-linear, with a >>> or a<<<<
- if there is no preferential attachment.
- How preferential attachment morph the network



{See also the [Bianconi–Barabási model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianconi–Barabási_model) to see if it is better, they should be almost the same but each node has a parameter called fitness that influence the acquisition of a new link instead of just the degree}
